tips:
1. Because the input I use is continuous search, loading will interrupt the operation, 
   so loading is not added.
2. This is the first time for me to use graphql requests, which were all restful requests before. 
   If have any questions, please let me know, thank you!
3. Perhaps for other considerations or other uses of graphql that I do not understand, 
   a small suggestion is that 'species_name', 'color' and other fields can be directly placed 
   under 'pokemon_v2_pokemon', do not need to go outside to get; 'color' can return the color value directly.
4. The server can return the search field to tell the client which search result was made, 
   preventing later results from being returned first.
5. If have any questions, please contact me anytime, Dean0105@126.com, thank you!
